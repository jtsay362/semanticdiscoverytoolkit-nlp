MODEL

Lexicon
 - finds the Categories (definition) for a (word/sub)string (token) of input

LexicalTokenizer
 <>-- DelimitedString
 <>-- Lexicon
 - uses a DelimitedString to tokenize text.
 - finds those strings that have definitions according to a lexicon
   or the smallest token that does not have any definition.
 - finds definitions from longest tokens to shortest tokens.
 - creates a LexicalEntry for the first longest definable token or for the smallest undefined token.

LexicalTokenizer.Pointer
 <>-- string token
 <>-- Categories
 - maintains token and position information relative to original string through a DelimitedString.
 - manages navigation through smaller and next definable tokens.

LexicalEntry
 <>-- LexicalTokenizer.Pointer
 <>-- newDefinition:Categories
 - keeps track of original, new, and combined definitions for a token.
 - helps manage navigation through smaller and next definable tokens.

LexicalToken
 <>-- LexicalEntry
 - wrapper around LexicalEntry for interface to FSM.
 - helps manage navigation through smaller and next definable tokens.
